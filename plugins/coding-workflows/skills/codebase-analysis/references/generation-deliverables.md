# Generation Deliverables

## For Agent Generation

What the agent generation phase needs from analysis:
- Role signals: which domains warrant architect vs reviewer vs specialist
- Cross-cutting concerns: domains that span multiple modules (security, observability)
- Checklist material: domain-specific review items from observed patterns

## For Skill Generation

What the skill generation phase needs from analysis:
- Validation criteria: what rules can be checked programmatically
- Pattern catalog: which patterns repeat across the codebase
- Anti-pattern signals: what mistakes are likely in each domain
